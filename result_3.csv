Working on iconic events such as Macworld Expo, Schneider Electric’s Innovation Summit and Anime Expo, the largest North American anime convention, has allowed me the opportunity to lead cross-functional teams, gain a rich understanding of each individual area, and manage them collectively to achieve the strategic mission of each event.  Working with renowned speakers, well-known brands, world-class venues, and incredibly talented event teams I am proud of my history of producing, launching, and managing successful events of all types and sizes. 

I am thankful for the time I spent on the agency side, which challenged me to view events through a more strategic lens. Supporting clients such as IBM, Oracle, and AbbVie I analyzed and improved the effectiveness of their portfolios and developed strategies to help them achieve their goals and objectives. 

Inside corporate marketing teams I was able to shape and reimagine face to face marketing tactics through experiential activities, sponsorship activations and innovative event elements. Whether it was an internal leadership event, customer hospitality or user conference the goal of surprising and delighting attendees was always at the forefront. 

 I’ve had the pleasure to share my knowledge at industry events and present at the Women of Isenberg Conference, of which I’m a proud alumnus. It’s my passion and desire is to help mentor and educate the next generation of event professionals. 

 Outside of my professional life I’m blessed to have an amazing husband and family (including two lovable canines), with whom I spend as much time as possible. If I’m not at a yoga class, kayaking or reading I'm likely cheering on my Boston sports teams or volunteering with Pittie Love Rescue. #adoptdontshop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/citizens-bank?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=profile_cta,Post IPO debt,750000000,USD,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/citizens-bank-post-ipo-debt--c85d79d4?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=last_funding,2025-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,0.0,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/citizens-bank-post-ipo-debt--c85d79d4?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=all_investors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the past two+ decades, I've built and managed successful creative brand marketing and communications platforms for many established companies. However, more importantly, guiding teams of driven, thoughtful individuals, I've helped foster meaningful dialogue and engagement around shared passions: one story, one message, one conversation at a time.

My professional sweet spot is when creativity, messaging, and data come together to tell an exciting, enduring story that connects with customers and stakeholders, and then doing that at scale. 

I've conceptualized, launched, produced, and managed corporate, employer, and product brands and communications platforms for technology companies, consumer brands, as well as for private organizations and universities – while managing and protecting the brands to ensure that the message, identity, domains, and positioning remains authentic and singular.

My specialties include:

Creative and strategic leadership; Brand portfolio strategy and management, including measurement and insights;  Brand reputation, protection, and domains; Creative brand positioning and visual system development and management; Creative strategy, messaging, and campaigns, including product and event brands; Digital and social media; content development and distribution; media and partnerships; and;

I lead functional areas including Sales, Solution Architects, Business Development, and Partner Management.

SELECT RESULTS:
⇨ Grew revenue 500% in 3 years by investing heavily in software service provider partnerships to create co-selling routes to market that included other hyper sellers such as Google, Microsoft, and AWS. I personally established partnerships with Google and Microsoft, which had reached multi-million-dollar value in under a year, and grew the existing AWS partnership 600%. 
⇨ Increased customer consumption 68% YoY for 3 years by developing data-backed growth projections that I used to direct sales teams to overachieve targets based on the percentage of committed but non-consuming customers identified in projections.

And today, Wellabe’s six insurance companies are licensed in 49 states and the District of Columbia and are recognized by AM Best as having excellent financial strength. 

Mr. Powell’s vision was to create a company founded on the principal of caring. While we have seen tremendous growth over the years, that same caring attitude has carried on to today and will continue to carry on for the next 100 years.

We are in a people helping people business, and our entire team is dedicated to always being here for our customers.

I can often be found trying to crack my wife and children up, still perfecting my 18 foot jumper or drumming aggressively on my steering wheel during rush hour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edelman-financial-engines?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=profile_cta,Private equity,,,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/edelman-financial-engines-private-equity--4e09d5ac?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=last_funding,2021-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,0.0,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/edelman-financial-engines-private-equity--4e09d5ac?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=all_investors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Warburg Pincus,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/warburg-pincus?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=linkedin_companies&utm_content=investor,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D4E38AQGeF0bnSx-8Zw/crunchbase_investor_logo_100/crunchbase_investor_logo_100/0/1749704209922?e=1751374800&v=beta&t=tySkB0Vy3DVZk_GG8fp_kFjE3tcjzaHaAaGEjozU_t8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Driven by purpose. Grounded in people. Focused on impact.

With over three decades in the mortgage industry, Sarah Middleton has built a legacy on growth, innovation, and the quiet strength of people-first leadership.

As Chief Growth & Marketing Officer at Supreme Lending, she leads national expansion strategies, brand elevation, recruiting, and marketing innovation—supporting loan officers and branch managers through a platform built on excellence, integrity, and service.

Supreme’s 26-year foundation is rooted in humility, heart, and high performance—values that align deeply with Sarah’s lifelong mission to enrich lives, empower others, and build what lasts. Her work centers on removing barriers, simplifying processes, and equipping sales leaders with the tools, coaching, and culture they need to thrive.

Prior to joining Supreme, Sarah served as Chief Growth Officer at Movement Mortgage, where she helped lead company-wide initiatives in sales development, onboarding, coaching, product expansion, CRM adoption, and leadership engagement. She also launched the VA Advisory Board, the Product Advisory Board, and the Changemakers platform.

Her previous chapter included nearly a decade at Fairway Independent Mortgage, where she served as President of Sales Development and CEO of Fairway Ignite, an internal coaching platform that supported over 1,500 originators and leaders.

Earlier roles include regional leadership at Guild Mortgage and Liberty Financial Group, where she led production growth from $0 to $2B annually. Her originator record—$2B and 11,700 units closed in Colorado—still stands today, powered by a loyal team she’s led for over 20 years.

UserTesting offers the industry's most comprehensive experience research solution.

Loop™ is an enterprise-grade SaaS platform and turnkey checkout solution that seamlessly integrates with a retailer's online store and essentially makes every product easily giftable. Buyers can purchase any product as a gift without the usual constraints, such as delivery time, or knowing the recipient’s style, color, size or shipping address. Recipients receive notifications of their gifts, and are directed to the retailer’s online store to accept them. Recipients can then configure gifts to suit their preferences, or 'virtually exchange' them online for something else before they ship to the address of their choosing.
